      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        This site is for purposely for providing comprehensible concepts in
        chemcal engineering most especially. As an aspiring process engineer, I
        am driven by a passion to unravel the intricacies of this dynamic field.
        Through my writingd, I aim to serve as a medium for understanding,
        breaking down complex concepts.
