        Ever wondered why the smell of perfume travels from one side of a room
        to the other? Or why some things can disappear when you mix them with
        liquids? It's like magic, right? Well, it's not really magic—it's
        something called <span>mass transfer</span>. It's how things move and
        mix with each other, like when you try to mix sugar into your drink or
        when you smell something from far away. Mass transfer is like the secret
        behind all these cool things happening around us further explains more
        principles like distillation, extraction, absorption and filtration.
        Let's delve deeper
      </p>
      <h3 class="Concept of Mass Transfer">Concept of Mass Transfer</h3>
      <p>
        Mass transfer is the principle whereby there is exchange of substances
        between two surfaces that are of different concentrations with each
        other. Mass transfer is about substances moving from where there's a lot
        (in terms of concentration) to where there's less. It can happen in
        gases or liquids, and it's due to the random speeds of molecules or
        currents in a fluid. In chemical engineering applications, it usually
        occurs between different phases, where the concentrations on each side
        are linked by phase equilibrium. It is the <span>net</span> movement of
        <span>mass</span> from one location to another. The locations vary as
        they may be from one phase to another phase, between solutions,
        fractions or from one component to another. The mass can mean tiny
        particles such as atoms, molecules and ions. In some cases, it involves
        phase changes occurring. For an example, when we take a look at
        distillation, we realize there is a phase change from liquid to vapor.
        Envision it as things swapping places, like when oil moves from a solid
        to a liquid in solvent extraction.

        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />As stated earlier, mass transfer can be used to explain multiple
        concepts. One of the useful models for mass transfer between phases is

          ><b>The two film theory</b></a
        >
        Mass transfer of solute from one phase to another involves transport
        from the bulk of one phase to the phase boundary or interface, then
        movement from the interface into the bulk of the second phase.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        We'll discuss how it applies to diffusion, but before diving into that,
        let's examine the driving force
      </p>
      <div class="field">
        <fieldset class="driving_force">
          <h3>Driving force</h3>
          <p>
            In a chemical process, a driving force is essential, providing the
            impetus, power, and energy for motion. In mass transfer, where
            particles move within different or identical phases, the driving
            force primarily arises from concentration or partial pressure
            gradients and difference in thermodynamic activity for the
            transferred material.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="../assets/driving force.jpg"
              alt="picture for diving force"
              class="picture"
            />
          </p>
          Consider an example: if I have a flux (flux; representing the amount
          of a specific species moving through a unit cross-sectional area per
          unit time), the driving force would be the concentration gradient
          (∆C/∆z). This is crucial because without a concentration change over a
          certain distance, no transfer occurs. The change in concentration
          indicates the transfer of a certain quantity of substance, such as
          mass, hence the concentration difference. The relationship is
          expressed as N = k (∆C/∆z)
          <br />
          <br />
          Flux refers to the quantity of substance passing through a specified
          area. Imagine flux as the flow of something, maybe water or air,
          through a specific area in a set amount of time. It denotes how much
          of that stuff (water or air) is moving through, and it depends on the
          concentration difference – how much of it there is at one end compared
          to the other. So if there is more of something on one side, it will
          flow or move towards the area where there's less of it.
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="drawback">
          <h3>Drawback</h3>
          <p>
            In certain cases, mass transfer processes might be undesirable, such
            as in dehydration and evaporation, where the loss of vaporous
            components can alter flavor, leading to reduced overall quality. A
            grasp of mass transfer principles help minimize drawbacks, allowing
            for increased processing rates without compromising quality.
          </p>
        </fieldset>
      </div>
      <div class="diffusion">
        <h3>Diffusion</h3>
        <p>
          Diffusion is a mass transfer phenomenon that promotes even
          distribution of a chemical species over space and time. It barely
          occurs across a membrane as substances would move from one phase
          (region) to the other (mostly from the highly concentrated region to
          the less concentrated region) until the particles are uniformly
          distributed across the two regions. Imagine dropping a solid, like
          solid KMNO4 crystal, into a clear water solution. Initially
          concentrated at one spot, the solid eventually leads to a uniform
          color change across the entire solution, depicting even distribution
          of the crystals inside the water solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diffusion processes occur in systems with varying concentrations,
          aiming to achieve equilibrium. In a quiescent system, the
          concentration differences resulting from molecular motion and hindered
          by internal friction become equal. The rate of diffusion in a fluid is
          primarily density-dependent, with liquids exhibiting slower rates (on
          the order of cm2 per day) compared to gases (on the order of cm2 s−1).
        </p>
        <p>
          The rate of diffusion can be expressed as the amount of substance
          passing through a unit volume per unit time, i.e. J. This amount is
          directly proportional to the concentration change per unit path length
          of the diffusing component, i.e. the concentration gradient, dc/dl.
          The correlation between mass transport and the concentration gradient
          is expressed by Fick's first law: J=-D dC/dl

      <p>
        Obiviously, there will be certain factors that will affect the rate of
        diffusion. Some of the factors are:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Concentration Gradient: A higher concentration gradient causes a
          higher rate of diffusion. A higher concentration gradient implies the
          particle travels a shorter distance with respect to its initial
          concentration to form a uniform distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Temperature: Thus diffusion rate increases as temperature increases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Resistance: This can be related directly to the formula of the
          diffusion rate equation. A higher resistance causes a lower diffusion
          rate as the rate of diffusion is inversely related to resistance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <fieldset class="ficks_law">
        <h3>A little on Fick's Law</h3>
        <p>
          The fundamental law governing diffusion is Fick’s law and was
          enunciated by a German physiologist, Adolf Eugen Fick. The law
          basically states that, the rate at which a molecule moves through a
          material is proportional to the concentration gradient between the two
          membranes and inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane.
          The thickness of the membrane is the distance that the species would
          move to diffuse through the medium. In a mathematical definition, it
          states that the molar flux of a species relative to an observer moving
          with average molar velocity is proportional to the concentration
          gradient of the species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a rate equation, we can relate the rate of diffusion to both the
          driving force and resistance. Upon setting these parameters equal, a
          constant of proportionality emerges.
        </p>
        <p>
          This constant signifies the quantity of a substance diffusing across a
          unit area in one second, denoting the speed and ease of dissolution
          for the diffusing particle. The constant is termed diffusivity
          coefficient.

          Diffusion is a very broad concept on its own. Assuming we are taking
          two substances as case study, we realize that there would be different
          instances of diffusion occurring. One could be the situation where one
          system is stationary and the other is not. Another could be where both
          of the species are diffusing together in concurrent or counter current
          fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diffusion is everywhere as it occurs in solids, liquids, spherical
          structures, (in the case of evaporation of droplets). Diffusion can
          occur in both

          and unsteady state (transient) conditions. Let's look at steady state
          a little further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steady state is a state where a process does not change or even if
          there would be changes, the changes occur slightly over time. It can
          also be a situation in which all state variables are constant in spite
          of ongoing processes that strive to change them. An example can be
          where a steel heated in a carbon rich atmosphere makes the carbon
          atoms diffuse into the steel hardening it. In a steady-state system,
          both parameters and variables remain constant, and there is no change
          in the system's state over time. For example, as a species like A
          diffuses from one location to another within a medium, both the
          concentration and the rate of transport of the species remain constant
          throughout the process. The solutions to this state problems may be
          viewed as states of equilibrium which only become altered when the
          forces ensuring the dynamicity of equilibrium are altered. This give
          rise to the concept of transient diffusion or unsteady state
          diffusion.

        <h3>Transient Diffusive Mass Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          For simplicity, virtually all problems are addressed as being at
          steady state. But this not the case, as we assume that variables and
          parameters (flux) are independent of time. It is unsteady state mass
          transfer where the diffusion is time dependent. It is a process where
          the rate of diffusion changes with temporal variation in
          concentration. This analysis focuses on the dynamic behavior of
          transfer as the transfer evolves over time.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Diffusion is a broad concept and is one of the applications of mass
          transfer. Mass transfer can be used to explain other principles and
          the main theory that can be seen as common to all will be the rate
          theories. Diffusion occurs in daily life and sometimes we are
          negligent of the fact that it is occurring. To design for example a
          power plant, other concepts in mass transfer is necessary as mass
          transfer is an undisputed basic building block of chemical
          engineering.
